# Splitter.Fm Challenge #2: Todo List

This was a coding challenge to create a todolist application, similar to Trello, using React, with the following requirements:

- Acceptable Libraries:
    - React (and Webpacker/babel whatever else is required to support React these days)
    - redux
    - jQuery
    - Lodash
- The app should allow you to do the following:
    - Create a to-do list (with a title)
    - Add a to-do item to a list
    - Remove a to-do item from a list
    - Edit a to-do item
    - Move a to-do item from one list to another


## Getting running

To get this running on your own machine, git clone this repo, then, in the project's root directory, run:

### `npm install`

This will ensure you have all of the required prequisites to run a development version of React on your system

After that, you can run

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
